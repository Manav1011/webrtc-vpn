I'll provide you with the list of commands needed to set up and run the WebRTC VPN on another computer. Here are the steps:

1. First, let me check the exact commands from config.txt:

Here's the complete list of commands needed to set up and run the WebRTC VPN on another computer:

1. Prerequisites Installation:
```bash
# Install Go (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install golang-go

# Install required system packages
sudo apt-get install build-essential

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webrtc-vpn.git
cd webrtc-vpn

# Install Go dependencies
go mod download
```

2. Interface Setup Commands (for the Offerer side):
```bash
# Create and configure the TAP interface
sudo ip tuntap add dev revpn-offer mode tap
sudo ip link set revpn-offer up
sudo ip addr add 172.16.0.1/24 dev revpn-offer
sudo ip link set dev revpn-offer mtu 1300
```

3. Interface Setup Commands (for the Answerer side):
```bash
# Create and configure the TAP interface
sudo ip tuntap add dev revpn-answer mode tap
sudo ip link set revpn-answer up
sudo ip addr add 172.16.0.2/24 dev revpn-answer
sudo ip link set dev revpn-answer mtu 1300
```

4. Build and Run Commands:
```bash
# Build the binaries
./run.sh build

# Run the offerer (on the first computer)
sudo ./run.sh offerer office

# Run the answerer (on the second computer)
sudo ./run.sh answerer office
```

5. Cleanup Commands (when done):
```bash
# Remove the TAP interfaces
sudo ip link delete revpn-offer
sudo ip link delete revpn-answer
```

Important Notes:
1. Both computers need to have:
   - Linux operating system
   - Root/sudo privileges
   - Go installed (version 1.16 or later)
   - Access to the same signaling server

2. Network Requirements:
   - Both computers need internet connectivity
   - UDP ports should be open for WebRTC (typically in the range 49152-65535)
   - Access to the signaling server (default port 8080)

3. Security Considerations:
   - Run the commands with sudo only when necessary (for network interface operations)
   - Make sure the signaling server connection is secure
   - Consider using a firewall to restrict access to the TAP interfaces

4. Troubleshooting Commands:
```bash
# Check interface status
ip addr show revpn-offer
ip addr show revpn-answer

# Check routing
ip route show

# Check interface logs
dmesg | grep revpn

# Check connectivity
ping 172.16.0.1  # from answerer
ping 172.16.0.2  # from offerer
```

Would you like me to:
1. Provide more detailed instructions for any of these steps?
2. Add any additional security recommendations?
3. Include any specific troubleshooting steps?
